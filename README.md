Recursion Polyfills
==============
Practice with some interesting recursion problems. Recursive reimplementations of two standby native JS functions.

This is a project I completed as a student at Hack Reactor Fulcrum, part of the pre-course for Hack Reactor Remote. 

The following JavaScript functions were reimplemented:
- getElementByClassName()
- parseJSON()


### Testing

Tests are made with the [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) testing framework.
Test are located in the ./spec directory. To run the Just open the spec runner file with chrome.
